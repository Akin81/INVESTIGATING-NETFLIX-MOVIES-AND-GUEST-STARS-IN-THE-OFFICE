# INVESTIGATING-NETFLIX-MOVIES-AND-GUEST-STARS-IN-THE-OFFICE
In this project, i had to apply the skills I gathered from the Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python in solving  a real-world data science problem.

This hands-on project has helped me to gain valuable experience in the field of data science. the exploratory data analysis allows me to perform critical tasks such of manipulating raw data and drawing conclusions from plots I create of the data.


Below are some of the steps i followed to get this project sorted
